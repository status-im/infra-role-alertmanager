alertmanager_admin_email: 'admin@example.org'

# SMTP fallback
alertmanager_admin_email: 'admin@example.org'
alertmanager_smtp_host: smtp.mail.example.org'
alertmanager_smtp_from: 'alerts@example.org'
alertmanager_smtp_user: 'secret-smtp-user'

```

# Details

AlertManager runs in a cluster to achieve high availability. The peer connect via [Tinc VPN](https://github.com/status-im/infra-role-bootstrap/tree/master/tasks/tinc).
The service listens on `:9093` and the Prometheus instance connects to that port via the VPN to inform it of threshold breaches.

The main configuration resides in [`templates/alertmanager.yml.j2`](templates/alertmanager.yml.j2).
It configures all the receivers of alerts generated by Prometheus __master__ instance.

The are three main sections:

* `global` - Configure general auth related options for SMTP and Slack receivers.
* `receivers` - Defines destinations of alets which can be used in the `route` section.
* `route` - Defines rules based on which alerts are directed to defined receivers.
